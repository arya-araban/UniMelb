### Assignment 1 - Laplacian Pyramid Image Compression
Laplacian pyramid construction and reconstruction functions were implemennted in Python, and the images were Compressed by quantizing pyramid layers and reconstructing the image.

Analyzed effects of compression on image quality and frequency content. Found a good balance between compression ratio and reconstruction error.

### Assignment 2 - Scene Classification with CNNs
The second assignment was to outline a research plan for the proposed research topic. In our case, unsupervised domain adaptation for monocular depth estimation from synthetic to real environments was investigated. The plan suggested a combination of domain randomization and generative adversarial networks, by providing a thorough explanation of the motivation, research question context, investigative and analysis methods, as well as the potential contributions of the study.
