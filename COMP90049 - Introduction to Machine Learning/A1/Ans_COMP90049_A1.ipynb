        "In this assignment, you will apply the Decision Tree (DT) classification algorithm to a real-world machine learning dataset. Specifically, you will predict the type of a given bridge using a diverse set of features, including its material, length, number of lanes, and other structural properties. We use a modified version of the publicly available <a href=\"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Pittsburgh+Bridges\"> Pittsburgh Bridges Data Set</a>. (click the link for more information on all features and values).\n",
        "\n",
        "In the **Data Preparation** section, you will read the dataset into a data frame and perform data preprocessing (Q1.1). You will also need to develop code to convert the features to numeric values (Q1.2). Then, the data will be divided into two parts: Train and Test.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the **Model Training** section, we provide you with a number of helper functions that will be incorporated into the main Decision Tree function (Q2-8). Your task is to read and use these functions and explain the exact role of each helper function in developing a Decision Tree. You must provide a meaningful and descriptive name for each function that matches its specific role in training a Decision Tree model (e.g., count_labels, calculate_entropy, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "You can observe the use of each of these functions in the Main Decision Tree Algorithm, which you can use to print your trained tree. We have also provided the code for navigating a trained tree and using it to predict the labels for the test dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the **Classification and Evaluation** section, you will test and evaluate your model. You will implement functions to calculate the accuracy of the model predictions (Q9). Finally, you will train a tree and use it to predict the labels for the test set and see the accuracy of your model (Q10).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q11 concludes with analytical questions in which you will critically analyze the behavior of your decision tree in different situations.\n"

This can cause the tree to give us much better accuracy for predicting labels of the training data, which is exactly what we see in this example. It is noteworthy that the more we increase the depth of a decision tree the more likely we are to create a model which overfits the training data and performs worse on unseen data. In this example we are getting the exact same accuracy results when predicting the test data on the two different tree lengths. The reason for this can be that when training a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 we are underfitting the data, but with a maximum depth of 10, we are overfitting the data, thus causing the same weak result. So as an example, if we select the maximum depth of the tree to be 4,  the accuracy of predicting the test data will be 0.47 which is much better than our previous result."
