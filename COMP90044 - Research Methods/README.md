# COMP90044 - Research Methods

### Assignment 1 - Literature Review
The first assignment was to write a literature review on a chosen research topic. The literature review was on monocular depth estimation using deep learning. It surveyed the evolution of methods and analyzed innovations in training, architectures, self-supervision, while also discussing remaining challenges, crucial datasets, metrics, and open problems.

### Assignment 2 - Research Plan
The second assignment was to outline a research plan for the proposed research topic. In our case, unsupervised domain adaptation for monocular depth estimation from synthetic to real environments was investigated. The plan suggested a combination of domain randomization and generative adversarial networks, by providing a thorough explanation of the motivation, research question context, investigative and analysis methods, as well as the potential contributions of the study.
