By identifying the most variable region in an MSA of viral sequences from different strains of a virus, insights into the evolution of the virus and its ability to evade the host immune system can be gathered. For example, a high degree of variability in a region encoding an antigenic site may indicate that the virus is evolving to escape recognition by host antibodies. Identifying the most variable region can help researchers design vaccines that target conserved regions of the virus and are effective against multiple strains."

    "WES targets only the protein-coding regions of the genome, while WGS aims to sequence the entire genome. The higher mean read depth for the LOC116420406 gene compared to the whole alignment suggests that the input reads may be WES, which typically generates higher coverage of the targeted regions than WGS."
