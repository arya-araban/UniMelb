# COMP90016 - Computational Genomics

### Assignment 1 - Working with short reads
This assignment focused on working with short DNA read data. Tasks included calculating read length statistics, adapter trimming of reads, and visualization of read length distributions before and after trimming.

----

### Assignment 2 - Sequence alignment and variant calling
This assignment covered sequence alignment and variant calling workflows. It involved using BLAST, generating pairwise and multiple sequence alignments, and calculating alignment metrics. Read alignment concepts were explored by aligning short reads to a reference genome. A basic haploid SNP caller was also implemented. 

----

### Assignment 3 - Workflows, phylogenetics and genome annotation
The final assignment covered workflows, phylogenetics, and genome annotation. Questions were answered on workflow software and reproducibility. Phylogenetic concepts like tree topology and imbalance were implemented. A genome annotation task involved predicting coding regions based on start/stop codons and reading frames.
