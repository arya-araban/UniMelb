# COMP90054 - AI Planning for Autonomy

### Assignment 1 - AI Search

This assignment focused on implementing search algorithms such as Enforced Hill Climbing and Enhanced Bidirectional A* in Pacman. The aim was to become familiar with AI search techniques and how to derive heuristics.

### Assignment 2 - PDDL Modelling
The goal of this assignment was to improve PDDL modelling skills and abstraction abilities. We modelled a tea-making robot using PDDL actions, predicates, etc. The model allowed customers the flexiblity to specify their own bubble tea recipes.

### Final Project - Azul
For the final project, the goal was to implement AI agents to play the board game Azul. We chose three techniques: Greedy Search, UCB1, and Minimax. Greedy Search selects the best immediate move. UCB1 balances exploration and exploitation to estimate the value of actions via simulations. Minimax considers the full game tree to choose optimal moves, using alpha-beta pruning to improve efficiency.
