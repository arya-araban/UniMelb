# COMP90086 - Computer Vision

### Assignment 1 - Decision Tree Classification
The first assignment involved implementing a decision tree classifier to predict bridge types using a dataset of structural features like material, length, and number of lanes. The tasks included data preprocessing, converting features to numeric values, developing helper functions for calculating entropy and splitting nodes, training the decision tree model, and evaluating its accuracy on a test set.

### Assignment 2 - Evaluating Classifiers
The second assignment focused on implementing and evaluating various classification models like naive Bayes, KNN, and decision trees on an amphibian dataset. We explored different evaluation metrics, preprocessing techniques, and analyzed the effects of modifications like balancing classes and removing outliers on model performance.

### Final Project - Job Salary Prediction
The final project involved developing models to predict job salaries from job descriptions. The models explored were random forests and neural networks. The analysis focused on comparing different text feature representations (TF-IDF vectors vs. sentence embeddings) and various techniques (supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised) using different amounts of labeled and unlabeled data.
