# COMP90089 - Machine Learning Applications for Health

### Assignment 1 - Defining a Digital Phenotype for Profound Hypotension
For this assignment, a digital phenotype was defined to identify patients with profound hypotension (hypotension lasting >60 minutes and corrected after intravenous vasoactive drugs) using MIMIC critical care data.

cohort identification algorithms were developed using SQL and Python, employing a comprehensive analysis of ICD codes, SNOMED mappings, and the MIMIC data model to construct the desired phenotype.

### Assignment 2 - Exploratory Analysis and Clustering of the Hypotension Cohort

The goal of this assignment was to perform Exploratory data analysis and k-means clustering on the hypotension cohort from the previous assignment.

Demographics, comorbidities, severity scores, and outcomes were examined. Subsequently, subphenotypes were identified through clustering techniques, and the differences in outcomes between these clusters was assessed.

### Final Project - Mortality Prediction for Sepsis Patients using Blood Glucose levels

In this final project, machine learning models were developed utilizing blood glucose data to enhance mortality predictions for sepsis patients.

The process involved data processing, phenotyping, exploratory analysis, and a comparative evaluation of multiple models such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, gradient boosting, and neural networks. The neural network model demonstrated superior performance among the evaluated models.
