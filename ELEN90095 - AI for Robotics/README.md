# ELEN90095 - AI For Robotics

### Assignment 1 - AI for engineering systems presentation

A 10-minute presentation was given on AI for Engineering Systems applied to prosthetics, covering various applications, and state-of-the-art methods alongside their pros and cons. This was followed by a 10-minute discussion session.

### Assignment 2 - Model Predictive Control (MPC) implementation

MPC was implemented for a Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system to study the effects of horizon length, objective function weights, and terminal objective options. The investigation analyzed the impact of horizon length on computation time and performance, explored the influence of objective function weights, and examined different terminal objective options.

### Assignment 3 - Sim2Real Line Following

This assignment involved a 1/10 scale car to facilitate the transfer of a policy from simulation to real-world implementation. The work included tuning and benchmarking a line detection algorithm and designing two controllers: a rule-based controller and a pure pursuit controller. The rule-based controller used logical rules and a constant steering angle offset, while the pure pursuit controller prioritized speed by looking ahead for targets. Performance evaluations showed the effectiveness of the controllers in following the road and completing the course.

### Final Project - Autonomous Driving Simulation-Based Policy Comparison

Synthesized, verified, and compared advanced policies for autonomous driving on high-speed roads with tight corners. Simulated roads were created, and performance metrics, such as the progress of the car on the road path, were defined. Policies were implemented using Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods, specifically Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO). PPO exhibited superior performance overall, while TRPO showed slightly faster execution.
