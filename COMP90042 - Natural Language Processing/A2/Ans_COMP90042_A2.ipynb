The order of characters is obviously important, yet this wasn't incorporated in any of the above models. Knowing that the word has the sequence `n _ s s` is a pretty strong clue that the missing character might be `e`. Similarly the distribution over characters that start or end a word are highly biased (e.g., toward common prefixes and suffixes, like *un-*, *-ed* and *-ly*).\n",

That's for you to decide.\n",

        "Your bigram guesser should apply your language model to each blank position in the secret word by using its left context character. For example, in the partial word `e _ c _ b _ _` we know the left context for the first three blanks, but have no known left context for the last blank. In the case for the last blank, you should revert to using a unigram language model (since there's no context for us to use the bigram model). You should sum up the probability distribution (over all alphabets from <i>a</i> to <i>z</i>) for the 4 blanks, and select the alphabet with the highest probability that hasn't been guessed.\n",

Then, we have to come up with a way to mix these two probabilites. I tried various methods such as weighted mean, geographic mean, and harmonic mean, and got the best results from geographic mean (although harmonic mean worked well too, but it is slower to compute) with my results generally getting the Average number of incorrect guesses as less than 8. Note that I also made some minor tweaks compared to the previous bigram implementation such as falling back to unigram_length_guesser model instead of unigram_guesser when two consecutive blank spaces are seen.\n",
