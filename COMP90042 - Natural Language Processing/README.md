# COMP90042 - Natural Language Processing

### Assignment 1 - Text Classification
The first assignment involved building a model to classify tweets by country of origin. The tasks included preprocessing tweets, creating bag-of-words representations, splitting data, training Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression models, tuning hyperparameters, and evaluating performance.

### Assignment 2 - Language Modeling for Hangman
The second assignment focused on creating an AI player for Hangman using n-gram language models. We built unigram and bigram models from an NLTK corpus, and used these to guide the AI player's next best guess at each step. The goal was to make the fewest mistakes through effective modeling of language.

### Final Project - Automated Fact Checking for Climate Science Claims
The final project focused on creating an automated fact checking system for climate science claims. Our solution involved fine-tuning a transformer model around a dataset of labeled claim-evidences pairs to generate semantic text representations, allowing a sentence transformer to encode claims and retrieve relevant evidence passages based on similarity. A classifier was then built to analyze the retrieved evidence and categorized each claim.
